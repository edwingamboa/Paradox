Hello, and thank you for downloading our Unity SeedFile scene.

First, here is a link to our wish lists and guides...
http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/unity
There you'll find tips and guidelines to help you get your asset selected on the first pass and avoid request for resubmission.

The technical requirements for assets are called out between our general guide document and each individual thumbnail sketch.
Conforming to the requirements is very important for us to be able to maintain runtime performance.


*** Unless otherwise noted, please limit material assignment to (1) per asset. Pivot point should be centered and at the base of the object where it contacts the ground plane.
If for some reason an exception is warranted, please fee free to contact us with specifics at:     unity@inxile.net


Included in this Unity seed file are the bare bones of a set up for the purposes of clarity and simplicity. A camera that approximates our games average position, a turn-table, a temporary fbx mesh with material (which you should replace), a few lights, and finally a scale figure from our game that should assist you in striking the right proportions for your mesh. Please help us by following the protocols established in it (i.e. game object files should live in the same places as the temporary assets in the scene, same file naming prefix/suffix useage, etc.).

Once you have completed your modelling and texturing of the asset, please attach it to the turntable (replace the placeholder cube fbx.)
This will help us, and more importantly you, see what your asset will look like to us. Please don't make changes to the properties of the lights, camera, or table. Though, if the prop you are working on is of a size that warrants moving one or more of them, please do so in moderation. When we receive your package for review, our hope is to open it, hit the play button, and within a few minutes approve it for purchase.

This is an important component of our crowd sourcing effort. As part of our partnership with Unity, and their in-engine Asset Store, we hope to connect with content creators out there in the Unity community. Wasteland2 is very much a fan influenced project, from our fund raising strategy to our integration of funder feedback, and we hope to continue this approach with Wasteland2 specific content creation.

Thanks again for getting involved. This is a very exciting time in indie game development, and I am thrilled to see what kinds of amazing things the crowd sourcing community can imagine and craft.
